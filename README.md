## Overview
Use Angular, TypeScript, Bootstrap, and HTML5 to build a dynamic website component

To begin, clone this repo and run 'npm install' from your command line

Once installed, you can enter 'npm start' to begin the application.
This will serve the front end content on localhost:4200 and the backend content on localhost:3000

### Goals:

1. Maintain a DRY approach to development
2. Use Angular's built-in MVC architecture to separate concerns
3. Research ARIA standards for coding with accessibility in mind

### Notes:

The node packages '@types/node', 'concurrently', and 'json-server' are only required to host the mock backend at localhost:3000.
When the project has a fleshed out backend, these should be removed to mitigate tech debt.
At that time, the folder 'backend' will be deprecated as well for the sake of consistency.
