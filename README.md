Using Angular, TypeScript, Bootstrap, and HTML5 to build a dynamic website component

To begin, clone this repo and run 'npm install' from your command line

Once installed, you can enter 'ng serve' to begin hosting content on localhost:4200

The stated goals of this project will continue to be refined over the next few months:

1. Maintain a DRY approach to development
2. Use Angular's built-in MVC architecture to separate concerns
3. Research ARIA standards for coding with accessibility in mind
